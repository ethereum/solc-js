/*
Basic, standardized Token contract with no "premine". Defines the functions to
check token balances, send tokens, send tokens on behalf of a 3rd party and the
corresponding approval process. Tokens need to be created by a derived
contract (e.g. TokenCreation.sol).

Thank you ConsenSys, this contract originated from:
https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/master/Token_Contracts/contracts/Standard_Token.sol
Which is itself based on the Ethereum standardized contract APIs:
https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Standardized_Contract_APIs
